            Hey there! I'm Darshan Dilip Deore, a recent graduate in Mechanical Engineering, having completed my
            Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech) last year. Currently, I'm immersing myself in the world of Responsive Web
            Design (RWD) at Seed Infotech. It's an exciting journey for me as I transition from the realm of mechanical
            engineering to the dynamic field of web development. I've always been passionate about learning and growing, and this
            opportunity to explore RWD is a testament to that. Despite my background in mechanical engineering, I've found myself 
            drawn to the creative and technical aspects of web design. Learning RWD at Seed Infotech is not just about acquiring new skills; it's about
            embracing a new perspective and expanding my horizons.As I delve deeper into RWD, I'm amazed by the endless
            possibilities it offers and the way it seamlessly blends design and technology. It's a thrilling experience to see my 
            ideas come to life on the screen, and I'm eager  to further hone my skills in this field.With each day of learning, I'm gaining insights into the intricacies
            of modern web  development and discovering new ways to create engaging and user-friendly experiences. My journey into RWD
            is just beginning, but I'm excited about the opportunities it holds and the potential it has to shape my future career.
