        Recently, a close friend sent me an e-mail with the subject line “Things
        Ive Noticed As I Get Older.” The ten numbered observations ranged from
        the mundane (politics is getting stupider) to the poignant (the distant
        melancholy of Facebooks News Feed, with its dispatches from lives that
        were once, and now no longer, close to ones own). But with all due
        respect to the observational chops of my correspondent, it wasnt so
        much the content of the message that impressed me as its form. It was an
        e-mail in the shape of a listicle, a personal correspondence structured
        for the purposes of frictionless social-media sharing. At some level, it
        seemed, my friend intended his e-mail to go viral within the highly
        targeted demographic of me. I couldnt help feeling that some basic
        epistolary protocol had been breached, that I was seeing an early sign
        of what could be a shift in the way people communicate.In the not too
        distant future, all human interactions, written or otherwise, might well
        be conducted in the form of lists—for ease of assimilation, for
        catchiness, for optimal snap. I imagined myself, some decades from now,
        nervously perched on the papered leatherette of an examination bed, and
        my doctor directing her sad, humane eyes at me a moment before clearing
        her throat and saying, “Top Five Signs You Probably Have Pancreatic
        Cancer.” I’ll admit that the above is a little on the fatalistic side, but we all recognize that the list is the
        signature form of our time. (“37 Pictures That Will Restore Your Faith in Pit Bulls.” “15 More Bizarre
        Kiddie Cartoon Conspiracy Theories.” “The 12 Meanest Ways to Tip a Waiter.” “22 Pictures of Miley Cyrus’
        Open Mouth.”) The stream of content that rushes through our lives often seems like an absurdist spectacle of
        randomly generated specifics, a comic nightmare of futile enumeration. The point of counting is, in a way,
        to get to the end of counting; but this is a counting that admits of no conclusion—a bottomless inventory of
        everything and nothing. (“8 of the Most Inappropriate Moments from Last Night’s VMAs.” “13 Signs You’re
        Addicted to Lip Balm.” “7 Disney Cartoons You Should Definitely Go Back To.” “6 Animals With Sex Lives That
        Are Weirdly Human.”)
