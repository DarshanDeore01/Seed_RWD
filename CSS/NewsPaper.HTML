                <h3 class="justified-paragraph margint">TikTok ban in US: How China may retaliate : </h3>
                <p class="justified-paragraph margint">
                    Now that President <strong>Joe Biden</strong> has signed off on a law that could expel TikTok from the US market,
                    Beijing must decide how best to retaliate over an attack on the world’s most-valuable start-up.
                    The legislation approved on Wednesday would give Chinese parent company ByteDance Ltd nearly a year
                    to divest the video-sharing platform before facing an outright ban.At a daily briefing hours before,
                    China’s foreign ministry directed reporters to a vow by commerce officials last month to take
                   <strong>“measures to resolutely safeguard its legitimate rights and interests.”</strong> 
                    President Xi Jinping’s government has so far shown restraint in responding to a drumbeat of US trade
                    curbs during a hawkish election season. <strong>The Communist Party’s moderation has been made easier by
                        Biden’s choice of largely symbolic actions, such as tariffs on metals China exports little of to
                        America.Driving TikTok — or its Chinese owner — out of the US could challenge that calibration,
                        making American firms with large exposure to China’s market, including Apple Inc and Tesla Inc,
                        potential targets for retaliation.</strong> Officials last year displayed their willingness to respond in
                    kind to a US campaign to kneecap Beijing’s access to advanced semiconductors, for example, by
                    launching a probe into American memory chipmaker Micron Technology Inc.
                    <strong>“China is keeping options open at the moment,” said Xiaomeng Lu, director of the geo-technology
                        practice at Eurasia Group. But she said if TikTok exhausts its legal options and has to exit
                        America, “some US tech brands could be at risk of becoming the collateral damage of this tit-for-tat
                        cycle.”</strong>
