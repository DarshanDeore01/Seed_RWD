        <h4>Align-Left</h4>
        Recently, a close friend sent me an e-mail with the subject line “Things
        Ive Noticed As I Get Older.” The ten numbered observations ranged from
        the mundane (politics is getting stupider) to the poignant (the distant
        melancholy of Facebooks News Feed, with its dispatches from lives that
        were once, and now no longer, close to ones own). But with all due
        respect to the observational chops of my correspondent, it wasnt so
        much the content of the message that impressed me as its form. It was an
        e-mail in the shape of a listicle, a personal correspondence structured
        for the purposes of frictionless social-media sharing. At some level, it
        seemed, my friend intended his e-mail to go viral within the highly
        targeted demographic of me. I couldnt help feeling that some basic
        epistolary protocol had been breached, that I was seeing an early sign
        of what could be a shift in the way people communicate. In the not too
        distant future, all human interactions, written or otherwise, might well
        be conducted in the form of lists—for ease of assimilation, for
        catchiness, for optimal snap. I imagined myself, some decades from now,
        nervously perched on the papered leatherette of an examination bed, and
        my doctor directing her sad, humane eyes at me a moment before clearing
        her throat and saying, “Top Five Signs You Probably Have Pancreatic
        Cancer.”. Text-Align: Left

        <P class="t-align-right">
            I’ll admit that the above is a little on the fatalistic side, but we all recognize that the list is the
            signature form of our time. (“37 Pictures That Will Restore Your Faith in Pit Bulls.” “15 More Bizarre
            Kiddie Cartoon Conspiracy Theories.” “The 12 Meanest Ways to Tip a Waiter.” “22 Pictures of Miley Cyrus’
            Open Mouth.”) The stream of content that rushes through our lives often seems like an absurdist spectacle of
            randomly generated specifics, a comic nightmare of futile enumeration. The point of counting is, in a way,
            to get to the end of counting; but this is a counting that admits of no conclusion—a bottomless inventory of
            everything and nothing. (“8 of the Most Inappropriate Moments from Last Night’s VMAs.” “13 Signs You’re
            Addicted to Lip Balm.” “7 Disney Cartoons You Should Definitely Go Back To.” “6 Animals With Sex Lives That
            Are Weirdly Human.”)

        <h4>Align-Center</h4>
        <p class="t-align-center">
            Last month, as an exercise in outside-the-box advertising in conjunction with their corporate sponsor Pepsi
            Next, BuzzFeed launched something called the ListiClock, a Web page that displays a flip clock with a
            BuzzFeed listicle for every hour, minute, and second of the day. As of this writing, for instance, the time
            is precisely 2:27:47 p.m., and this fleeting moment is illustrated by the following listicles: “2 Messages
            from the Romney Campaign,” “27 Toys You Threw Out That Are Worth a Fortune Now,” and “47 Superb Owls.” (I
            clicked on the owls, fearing that I would never again have a chance to see them; they were, to be fair,
            uniformly superb.)
        </p>
        <h4>Align-Justify</h4>
        <p class="t-align-justify">
            The seconds flip by with such remorseless speed that it’s almost impossible to read the title of one
            listicle before it’s replaced by another. The result is an endless succession of half-glimpsed enticements:
            “18 Things You Probably Didn’t …,” “11 Reminders That …,” “29 Most Interesting …,” “20 Breathtaking Photos
            of … .” If you watch any clock for long enough, especially one that displays the seconds as they pass, a
            particular kind of despair sets in. Here, now, is a time that will never be again; and now—this exact
            moment—is already gone; and you are now one second closer to death, etc. The ListiClock, with its unceasing
            enumeration of enumerations, heightens this anxiety. It not only becomes an intense reminder of the ongoing
            depletion of our store of moments but also points to a means of depleting them that is, arguably, among the
            most fruitless of all: diversion unto death. This is probably not the kind of brand extension that Pepsi
            Next had in mind with their sponsorship of the ListiClock.

        <h4>Text-Indent-15px</h4>
        <P class="t-indent-15px">
            In an interview with The Paris Review twenty years ago, Don DeLillo mentioned that “lists are a form of
            cultural
            hysteria.” From the vantage point of today, you wonder how much anyone—even someone as routinely prescient
            as
            DeLillo—could possibly have identified list-based hysteria in 1993. DeLillo’s statement also hints at
            something
            crucial about the list as a form: the tension between its gesturing toward order and its acknowledgement of
            order’s impossibility. The list—or, more specifically, the listicle—extends a promise of the definitive
            while
            necessarily revealing that no such promise could ever be fulfilled. It arises out of a desire to impose
            order on
            a life, a culture, a society, a difficult matter, a vast and teeming panorama of cat adorability and
            nineties
            nostalgia. Umberto Eco put it dramatically: “The list is the origin of culture. It’s part of the history of
            art
            and literature. What does culture want? To make infinity comprehensible. It also wants to create order.”

        <p class="t-indent-25px">
            But even the most definitive-seeming inventories are always undermined by a sense of their own
            arbitrariness.
            There’s an absurdity—a hysteria—that lurks between the lines of the most stern and sober of lists. Whoever
            wrote
            the Ten Commandments (or “10 Judeo-Christian Moral Injunctions You Need in Your Life Right Now”) was surely
            aware that it could just as well have been eight, or eleven, or seventy-seven commandments. (You get the
            sense
            that God, or whoever, could have gone on prohibiting and decreeing things all day, but that He was well
            aware of
            His people’s already compromised powers of attention.)

        <h4>Text-Indent-30px</h4>
        <p class="t-indent-30px">
            The rise of the listicle obviously connects with the Internet’s much-discussed effect on our ability (or
            desire)
            to sit still and concentrate on one thing for longer than ninety seconds. Contemporary media culture
            prioritizes
            the smart take, the sound bite, the takeaway—and the list is the takeaway in its most convenient form. But
            even
            when the list, or the listicle, has nothing really to do with useful information, it still exerts an occult
            force on our attention—or on my attention, at any rate. (“34 Things That Will Make ’90s Girls Feel Old.” “19
            Facts Only a Greek in the U.K. Can Understand.” “21 Kinds of Offal, Ranked By How Gross They Look.”) Like
            many
            of you, I am more inclined to click on links to articles that don’t reflect my interests if they happen to
            be in
            the form of countdowns. And I suspect my sheep-like behavior has something to do with the passive
            construction
            of that last sentence. The list is an oddly submissive reading experience. You are, initially, sucked in by
            the
            promise of a neatly quantified serving of information or diversion. There will be precisely ten (or
            fourteen, or
            thirty-three) items in this text, and they will pertain to precisely this stated topic. You know exactly
            what
            you’re going to get with a listicle. But there’s also a narrower sense in which you don’t know what you’re
            going
            to get at all. You know you’re going to get twenty-one kinds of gross offal, yes, but you don’t know which
            kinds
            of offal or how gross they’re going to be. Once you’ve begun reading, a strange magnetism of the pointless
            asserts itself
